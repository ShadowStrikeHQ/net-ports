## Net-Ports

### Project Description

Net-Ports is a cybersecurity tool designed to map open ports and identify running services on target systems. It provides a comprehensive view of the network environment and assists in detecting potential security vulnerabilities.

### Installation Instructions

To install Net-Ports, run the following command:

```Bash
pip install net-ports
```

### Usage Examples

To use Net-Ports, open a terminal window and type:

```Bash
net-ports [options] target
```

Where:

* `target` is the IP address or hostname of the target system.
* `options` are additional command-line arguments (see below).

Common options include:

* `-p`: Specify a specific port or range of ports to scan.
* `-s`: Enable stealth mode for discreet scanning.
* `-v`: Verbose output for detailed results.

### Security Warnings
